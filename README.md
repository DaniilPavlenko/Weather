# Weather App

## What is it?

This is **my test project** for my first job **in 2019** 🤓

👨🏻‍💻 In 2024, I decided to rewrite this shit. It's still shit, but with less smell.

## How to build the project?

To build the project provide your API key to OpenWeather API in the root `local.properties` file
with `openweather.apikey` property.

```properties
# in your root local.properties
openweather.apikey=YOUR_KEY
```

**Don't have a key?** Get it [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) for free.
